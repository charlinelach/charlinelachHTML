I created a website to test my abilities with HTML/CSS.
<br>
I have owned this website since 2016 since it was cheap, and I wanted to own it. Upon taking the 2020 Coding Boot Camp, I found that I could finally use the website with the new skills I learned.
<br>
Currently, the website is all HTML/CSS, but I hope to use JavaScript and React. Still TBD.
