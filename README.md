I created a website to test my abilities with HTML/CSS.
<br><br>
I have owned this website since 2016 but never utilized it until late 2021. I dedicded to finally use some of the skills I gained during the Fall 2020 Coding Boot Camp.
<br><br>
Currently, the website is all HTML/CSS, but I hope to use JavaScript and React. Still TBD.
